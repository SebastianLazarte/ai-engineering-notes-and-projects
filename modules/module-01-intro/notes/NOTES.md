# Module 01 — Introduction to Machine Learning

## Key Concepts
- What is ML and why it matters
- ML lifecycle (iterative process)
- Role of an ML/AI Engineer
- Tools: Python, scikit-learn

## My Takeaways
- Use Cases
Data Scientist → Descriptive & Predictive (EDA, churn prediction, sales forecast).
AI Engineer → Prescriptive & Generative (recommendation engines, copilots, conversational AI).
Data
DS → structured/tabular (but can sometimes do unstructured, less common).
AI Eng → unstructured, massive scale, billions of tokens/images.
Models
DS → many small, narrow models (each trained per use case).
AI Eng → few large foundation models, adapted via prompting, fine-tuning, RAG, agents.
Process
DS → define use case → clean structured data → engineer features → train/tune ML model → deploy.
AI Eng → define use case → pick pre-trained foundation model → adapt via prompt/fine-tune → integrate into workflows/apps.
